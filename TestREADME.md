### GET  test-only/verification-question/journey/:journeyId/status

### Using the Authenticator stub

This stub returns different responses based on the entered last name.

`fail` & `deceased` will return a data mismatch which upon submitting CYA will redirect the user to an error page.

`no-sautr` will return the data the user has entered and allow them to pass successfully provided the enableSautrCheck boolean is false or the user has clicked the `I do not have an SAUTR` link when the boolean is enabled.

Any other last name will return the data user has entered along with `1234567890` for the SAUTR. This is the SAUTR the user must provide in order to pass validation using this stub.

| Last Name                               | Response
|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------
| ```fail```                              | ```Unauthorized```
| ```deceased```                          | ```FailedDependency```
| ```no-sautr```                          | ```Ok``` (See above)
| Any other last name                     | ```Ok```


### Using the Known Facts stub

This stub returns different response bodies based on the sautr entered.

The 'Use stub for Known Facts API' feature switch will need to be enabled to use this.

#### Sautr: 0000000000
___
Mimics a response for users without a UK SA postcode. If user asserts they have no SA postcode and IsAbroad if returned as true then identifersMatch will be stored as true

Status: **OK(200)**

Response body:
```
{
 "service": "IR-SA",
 "enrolments": [{
     "identifiers": [{
         "key": "UTR",
         "value": "0000000000"
     }],
     "verifiers": [{
         "key": "IsAbroad",
         "value": "Y"
     }]
 }]
}
```

#### Any other sautr
___
Mimics a response for users with a UK postcode. If this matches the SA postcode entered by the user then identifersMatch will be stored as true

Status: **OK(200)**

Response body:
```
{
 "service": "IR-SA",
 "enrolments": [{
     "identifiers": [{
         "key": "UTR",
         "value": "1234567890"
     }],
     "verifiers": [{
         "key": "Postcode",
         "value": "AA1 1AA"
     }]
 }]
}
```
